Introduction
=============

The ARM mbed Device Connector is a web service that lets you securely and energy efficiently connect Internet of Things (IoT) devices to the cloud, enabling data communication and device management. Devices are then available through REST APIs to enterprise software, web applications and cloud stacks.Â 

In a nutshell, mbed Device Connector simply connects devices and web applications.

To help device manufacturers join the Internet of Things, ARM mbed created mbed Client: a library that connects devices to mbed Device Connector Service, mbed Device Server (mDS) and to mbed-enabled cloud services from our partners.

All in all, mbed Device Connector is the glue between devices with mbed Client library and the web applications as illustrated below.
